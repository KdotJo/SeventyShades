Today I created the files for the startup. I currently have about 5 different files my main index in which I 
will be working with to create the structure of the startup and 4 season that I will use to make sure that the 
user can navigate through the website to find clothing that match their style. I currently have placed buttons for 
differing season colors so that will help for now to see different places that my user will navigate to.
